# Language Learner Site

## Description

Our team was tasked with solving a real world issue and creating a website with fluid functionality. We collaborated to create a page with language learning resources.

We began with Spanish, and the code will allow for resources for multiple languages to be added in the future. Finding the tools to learn a new language can be hard, so we provided a user with a smaller set of options to minimize the difficulty in choosing the resource needed.

Through this, we learned more about the servers, and how they link with the front end of the site, as well as more practice with seeds and routes.

## Installation

To use this site from the back end, the user will need to install the following dependencies:

bcrypt: "^5.0.0",
connect-session-sequelize: "^7.0.4",
dotenv: "^8.2.0",
express: "^4.17.1",
express-handlebars: "^5.2.0",
express-session: "^1.17.1",
handlebars: "^4.7.6",
mysql2: "^2.2.5",
node: "^19.2.0",
sequelize: "^6.27.0"

## Usage

The site is built to be easy to use. Clicking a category along the page (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) will lead you to the book collection for the category. Each book will show the title, author, price, link, and will also show if an audiobook is available. Clicking Home will return you to the front page.
